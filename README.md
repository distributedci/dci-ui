# dci-ui

Source code for dci user interface. [https://distributed-ci.io](https://distributed-ci.io)
dci-ui is a static web app pluggable through CORS on a DCI server.

## Work In Progress

We recently migrate DCI from AngularJS to React.
The bundle size optimization will be done in the future.

## Getting started

To run the app in development mode follow those steps:

 * clone this repository
 * ensure DCI api is listening on localhost:5000. See `dci-dev-env`. 
   An alternative is to change `apiURL` to `https://api.distributed-ci.io` in [src/config.json](src/config.json) file.
 * install node dependencies: `npm install`
 * run the development server : `npm start`

## Build tools

To manage the workflow the project use npm scripts

Command list:

 * `npm start`: start web server with live reload
 * `npm run build`: build application in `build/` folder
 * `npm run test`: start unit test
